            <p>Hi, my name is Lissette, I love using code to solve problems and build things that people will be able to enjoy. I was born in Maryland, 
              I love cute animals, and I have a sweet tooth. I love learning different programming languages because this allows me to round off my tool box
               and be able to have more choices to choose from to solve each problem that comes my way. My favorite language is JavaScript due to it's
                versitility. Outside of programming, I also like  participating in anime group choir projects since I love feeling productive through working
                 on projects that bring people together.   </p>

    <h3>University of Michigan  Student</h3>
    <p> On top of my triumphs in my programming classes,  conquering Calculus concepts, and immersion in the Japanese language, 
      I am also in a club that helps develop  block chain apps, and have joined a club to organize hackathons. I love being able to learn about and contribute to many different things. I also am getting to meet many different people, learning from them, and learning from others.  </p>

<div class="exp exp-2">
    <h3>Discord Bot</h3>
    <p>I am also working on a bot for the social platform Discord that is able to help conduct a simplified version of the game Cards Against Humanity. I love working on this because I got to learn so much about Node and Javascript in general. I'm also gaining experience in solving so many different problems.  </p>

<div class="exp exp-3">
    <h3> Anime Virtual Choir Mixing</h3>
     <p>I use reddit to organize groups of people singing certain anime songs.  I love being part of that community and working with people around my age to make amazing projects. I also really got to bond with the people in my group. </p>
